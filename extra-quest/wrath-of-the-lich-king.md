## Story and Plot

The Lich King was the master and lord of the [Scourge](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Scourge) which he ruled telepathically through the [Helm of Domination](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Helm\_of\_Domination) from his [Frozen Throne](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Frozen\_Throne) atop [Icecrown Citadel](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Icecrown\_Citadel).When Ner'zhul attempted to escape [Draenor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor), he was immediately apprehended by the demon lord [Kil'jaeden](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Kil'jaeden). Kil'jaeden tore the old [shaman](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Shaman)'s body apart, but kept his spirit intact and aware. Ner'zhul begged for death, but Kil'jaeden said he still had a purpose to serve. He offered Ner'zhul one last chance to serve the [Burning Legion](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion) or face eternal torment. When the [orc](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Orc) recklessly agreed, Kil'jaeden encased his spirit in a block of diamond-hard ice from the distant reaches of the [Twisting Nether](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Twisting_Nether). Encased within the frozen cask and warped by the demon lord's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand ten thousand-fold and he became a spectral being of unfathomable power: the Lich King. The new being was sent to Azeroth with the Helm of Domination and Frostmourne merged with his icy tomb.

Despite his demise, the demon lord had left three Dreadlords outside Lordaeron's ruined palace to ensure control over the kingdom and keep watch on Ner'zhul, the treacherous servant (Lich King's real name). Unaware of their master's fate, the Dreadlords vanished when Arthas returned months later to reclaim his throne, threatening them. Alongside Sylvanas and Kel'Thuzad, Arthas sought to crush the last human stronghold, sparking a battle between the Undead and the valiant humans led by Paladins Dagren the Orcslayer, Halahk the Lifebringer, and Magroth the Defender.

In the ongoing struggle against the Lich King and his subordinates - the oligarchs Ignus, Isair, and Tyreal - heroes faced challenges within Sanctuary. To face the Lich King mentally, players needed to equip themselves with the appropriate items and combat strategies to confront each oligarch and ultimately the Lich King on Icecrown Glacier.

## Map and Bosses

### Palace Garden

Boss: God Of Fire

![image](../.gitbook/assets/image (83).png)

Explore the ancient castle teeming with a variety of monsters, some with formidable life points. Concealed within is The Summoner – the God of Fire.

![image](../.gitbook/assets/image (84).png)Summoner believes he can bend the forces of evil to his will. What he doesn't know is that evil takes advantage of people, not vice versa. In the end, he had to receive his end at the hands of a new group of heroes, pursuing the Dark Wanderer. Deckard Cain, who recognized the Summoner as the Wizard he knew in Tristram, hoped that the Summoner would find peace in death. However, he admitted that there was a high chance the Summoner would be dragged into Burning Hell by the demons he was forced to – a warning about the perils of magic.

After defeating the Summoner, the next level will be opened.

### Dark Ruin

Boss: Ignus

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (85).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There is a burning man hovering in the air over a grille in the [Smoldering Corpse Bar](https://torment.fandom.com/wiki/Smoldering_Corpse_Bar). His skin bubbles and chars, and flames pour from his tormented eyes, yet his expression is far away, almost as if he were reveling in the flames.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (86).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

A pyromaniacal mage, Ignus is a [chaotic neutral](https://torment.fandom.com/wiki/Alignment) character that can be recruited to [The Nameless One](https://torment.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nameless_One)'s party.

### Oni Hill

Boss: Isair

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (87).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Isair is described as a twisted sorcerer with power equal to any master in Arcane's Master Tower.

Half-elf and half-demon, Isair has characteristics typical of elves and demons. He was about six and a half meters tall, and stood on two feet. He has dark red skin, wide and feathery wings, twisted legs, and a tail. It is possible that Isair carried a larger version of the great knife Iyachtu Xvim.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (88).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Isair is a powerful sorcerer with combat training and fights his enemies with two great swords.### Way To Heaven

Boss: Tyrael - Archangel of Justice

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (90).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Before meeting Tyrael - Archangel of Justice, heroes must pre-select 5 paths including 100 random steps to find the gate of The Sky Chamber.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (92).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Tyrael, formerly Archangel of Justice, now Aspect of Wisdom, is a mortal angel. He is a staunch defender of Sanctuary and humanity, but is considered a traitor by the Council of Angiris.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (93).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Like the angel belonging to the giant Anu and Heaven, like the devil of Hell and the great dragon Tathamet. As the Archangel of Justice, Tyrael took part in the Great Conflict, and his exploits in battle became legendary. According to Imperius, he and Tyrael saved each other's lives countless times during the conflict. Off the battlefield, he runs the Court of Justice.

### Icecrown Glacier

Boss: Arthas – The Lich King

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (94).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The last boss, at the top of Icecrown Glacier – Arthas – The Lich King.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (95).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Arch Angel of Justice? Before becoming mortal? After that, he was only one fifth of Anu's strength. He is a millennium old creature with the experience of fighting tens of thousands of battles.

I like the Lich King, but he is a combination of a very strong Death Knight with Nerzhul, and who is Nerzhul? Undoubtedly one of the strongest mages in the world, with great power from the Burning Legion. However, that is a different scale of strength.
