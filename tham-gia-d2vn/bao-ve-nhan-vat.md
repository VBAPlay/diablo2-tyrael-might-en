### To increase security for players' characters to avoid unwanted looting or account hacking, D2VN has added an extra layer of protection for players' characters.

To create a pass for your character, follow these steps:

* **Step 1**: Log into your character, then at the bottom, select Setting Password Character classes.

* Step 2: The Password Character panel will appear, where you enter the character password below the yellow text "Enter New Password" - maximum of 16 characters. Try to make this password slightly different from your account password.
