* When creating a new character, you will be given a [CHEST NEWBIE](https://diablo2-vn.com/tm/vat-pham/chest-newbie-va-nhung-dieu-can-luu-y/) immediately upon entering the game instead of having to purchase it, remember to have an empty inventory to open the CHEST. Check this [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6cS6t9UKFmXKR71uJ0sre1bF1-75KdUY) for starting with the CHEST ITEM.
* When you have no gear:\
  Invite friends to play together, gain more experience for leveling up quickly when killing monsters, have a relaxed gameplay to avoid frequent deaths, and save a lot of time. Playing together to complete quests provides bonuses like increased strength.\
  You will receive 12 skill points, 15 starting points, 30 resistance to all types of damage, 3 socketed items, and some runes for a character upon completing all normal, nightmare, and hell quests.
* When reaching level 60:\
  Play together in hell difficulty, then set up Baal Hell runs consecutively. The more characters (up to 8) in the Baal Hell run, the faster you will level up compared to anywhere else in the game.\
  NOTE: Experience gained for leveling up depends on the current level of your character and those playing with you. Thus:&#x20;
* From level 1 to 20: play with others under level 25 and complete act 1 normal, act 2 normal together. If you finish act 2, train at the act 2 last waypoint to reach level 20.
* From level 20 to 25: go to the cow level in normal if possible. (You can rush through normal - pass the levels and defeat Baal in act 5 then return to play the cow level in normal) Or Baal in normal.
* From level 25 to 40: at level 25, you can play with any high-level character and still receive full experience. If possible (with assistance), go to the Chaos Sanctuary in act 4 nightmare to reach level 40. If not, play Baal in normal together until level 40.
* From level 40 to 60: once you reach level 40, meet the criteria for night difficulty, defeat Baal at night to complete that level. Then, if possible (with someone to guide you), proceed to Chaos Sanctuary in hell to reach level 60. If not, continue playing Baal at night until level 60".- At level 60, you are capable of progressing through hell: rush through hell to complete it. Group up to continually Boss Hunt (BH) to level up, at least to level 70 to be able to easily solo.
  - When you reach level 70:
    1. Consider heading straight to Cow Hell to farm items like socketed gear with Perfect Topaz for increased %MF.
    2. With enough socketed items (armor + helm) with Perfect Topaz, you will have a decent MF, you can then run Mephisto Hell for some loot, it's worth doing it even thousands of times. It is always a favorite among players for its cute and easy-to-kill drops. (You can solo Mephisto without taking any damage, ask your in-game friends for tips, it's simple in-game, only takes 5 minutes to explain).
    3. You can go to AT (Accident Tuner): at waypoint 4 - Lost City in Act 2 Hell, this is a Level 85 area suitable for a Cold Sorceress because there's no Cold immunes, only occasionally a Cold immune boss, just skip it or let your mercenary handle it if capable. I'll explain what Area 85 is and how to build your mercenary later.

- No need to say more, if you follow this guide, you'll become a Pro (full Clip available)\
Note: I'll assist you with what you need and what you don't need for a good start!!!\
Wish you a successful start!!

- Farming in Level 85 maps, just keep going, don't be discouraged by 100-200 runs with no good loot, sometimes running 5-600 runs to find 2-3 good items is completely normal.\
  -> Goal: we'll farm to find better gear for building characters.

- Once you have built relatively strong characters, we'll focus on farming, and who knows, during the farming process, we might find even better items to prepare for the next conquest, which is the SALVATION 1 map. (Open Extra Quests in the Quest menu - Press 'Q' and select the Extra Quest icon near the '?' button).
- The current map progression is: Salvation (Mod Map 1 - MM1) - Lich King (Mod Map 2 - MM2) - Uber 2 - Cow2 Hell".
