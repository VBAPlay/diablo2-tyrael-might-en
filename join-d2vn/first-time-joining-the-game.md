| - Chúc các bạn chơi Game vui vẻ !! Welcome to Server Diablo2 – VietNam                                        |So you have completed the process of creating a game account. Here are some small notes for you:

- When creating a new character, you will receive [CHEST NEWBIE](https://diablo2-vn.com/tm/vat-pham/chest-newbie-va-nhung-dieu-can-luu-y/) immediately upon entering the game instead of having to buy it, remember to keep your inventory empty to open the CHEST. Watch the starting video with CHEST ITEM for reference [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6cS6t9UKFmXKR71uJ0sre1bF1-75KdUY).
- When you don't have gear:
  Team up with friends to gain more experience points for leveling up quickly when killing monsters, staying safe, and saving a lot of time. Going on quests together earns you bonuses like increased strength.
  You will receive 12 skill points, 15 starting points, 30 res all, 3 socketed items, and some runes for a character when completing all normal, night, and hell quests.
- When reaching level 60:
  Collaborate to venture through hell, then create more Baal runs (Baal hell) in rapid succession for faster leveling up. If the room is full (8 characters), you will level up faster than anywhere else in the game.
  NOTE: The experience gained to level up depends on the current level of your character and those you team up with. Therefore:
  From level 1 to 20: Team up with those below level 25 to clear act 1 normal, act 2 normal. Train at the final waypoint of act 2 to reach level 20.
  From level 20 to 25: Consider farming cow level normal if possible. (You can rush through normal, defeat Baal in act 5, then return to clear cow level normal) or Baal normal.
  From level 25 to 40: You can team up with any higher-level character to receive full experience. If possible (with assistance), clear the Chaos Sanctuary in act 4 night to reach level 40. Otherwise, collaborate to clear Baal normal until level 40.
  From level 40 to 60: Once you are ready for night difficulty at level 40, defeat Baal in night difficulty to complete it. Then if possible (with assistance), venture into Chaos Sanctuary in hell difficulty to reach level 60. If not, continue with Baal runs in night difficulty until level 60.- At Lv60 you are capable of passing through hell: rush hell to complete hell. Invite each other to continuously BH to level up, at least reach level 7x to be able to easily separate and solo.
- When reaching level 7x:

   1. Immediately think of cow hell to find items with sockets to insert per toza to increase %MF.
   2. Having enough items (armor + helmet) with per toza sockets will give us decent MF, you can ask Mephisto hell for some items, even going to Mephisto hell thousands of times is worth it, it is always favored by members for its cute and easy-to-beat item drops. (You can solo Mephisto without losing health, ask your friends in the game to show you, it's simple in the game, just 5 minutes, explaining it is a long story).
   3. You can go to AT (accident tuner): at wp (waypoint) 4 - Lost City in act 2 hell: this is an area 85 suitable for sorc cold because there are no cold immunes, only occasionally there is a boss immune to cold, you can simply skip it, or let your mercenary kill it if they are capable enough. What is area 85 and how to build a mercenary, I will explain later.

- Not saying much, if you all go through this entire article, you will become a Pro (with a complete Clip).  
   Note: I will help you with what you need and what you don't need at the startup!  
   Wish you all successful beginnings!!

- Farm at maps level 85, be patient, if you have run 100 - 200 rooms and found nothing, don't be discouraged, sometimes you can run 5-600 rooms and get 2-3 good items, it's totally normal.  
   -> Goal: we will farm to find better gear to build upon.

- Then when the characters are quite strong, we will focus on farming and who knows our farming process will bring us even better items to be ready to move on to the next conquest which is the SALVATION map 1. (Open Extra Quest in the Quest - Press the Q key and select the icon near the ? key to view).
- The current map sequence is: Salvation (Mod Map 1 - MM1) - Lich King (Mod Map 2 - MM2) - Uber 2 - Cow2 Hell.
