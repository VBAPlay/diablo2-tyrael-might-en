### THE DRUID

Druids are a race of poet-warrior-kings deeply attuned to nature, making their home in Scosglen of the Barbarians. They eschew traditional magic, or Dubhdroiacht as they call it, in favor of Caoi DÃºlra, a philosophy that encourages harmony with the natural world. Instead, they practice a form of magic rooted in their close relationship with nature. Through this intimate bond with the Sanctuary world, a Druid has the power to control fire, earth, and wind. They are deeply intertwined with the natural world.
