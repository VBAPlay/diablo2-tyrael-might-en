# Amazon

### THE AMAZON

Amazon is a powerful female warrior of the Askari, who belong to groups of nomads living around the Southern Sea region. The wandering lifestyle of these groups often leads to conflicts with other tribes, so Amazon is accustomed to fighting to protect herself. This way of life has made her fiercely independent and capable of overcoming harsh challenges and traveling. While her archery skills rival those of Rogues, Amazon is also proficient in using Spears and Javelins, as well as dual wielding in combat. The weapons of Amazon are items that only she can equip. These are special types of Bows, Javelins, and Spears. Amazon is highly sought after as a mercenary, in a service where she will remain loyal as long as her own purpose is served.
