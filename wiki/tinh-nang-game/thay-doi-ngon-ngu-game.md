# ðŸŒŽ Changing the game language

For most of us born in the 80s or 90s, the image of a computer with a curved screen is very familiar with titles like empire, cs 1.1.. or the classic RPG game Diablo 2. As of now, Diablo 2 is over 20 years old but replaying it still brings back a lot of special emotions with a gameplay that is not at all boring for everyone. If you want to relive a bit of your childhood, just download Diablo 2!
