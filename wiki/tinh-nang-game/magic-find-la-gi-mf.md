# ðŸ‘€ What is Magic Find? (MF)

### Magic Finding

#### Basics

* **arealvl**: the level of a specific area, the higher the level, the higher the arealevel. Mobs in this area have a minimum level equal to the arealevel.
* **alvl**: affix level. This means the prefixes and suffixes of an item at level a will determine what options the item has.
* **clvl**: character level. This is only important when gambling.
* **ilvl**: the level of the item itself. Each item has its own level, which can be determined by looking at the level of the mob that dropped the item (use c3po to see).
* **mlvl**: mob level. mlvl is used to determine whether it will drop items with a high or low ilvl. mlvl is always greater than or equal to a lvl. Champion, ghostly mobs, etc., have mlvl = a lvl + 2. Random super uniques and their minions have mlvl = alvl + 3. Bosses and super uniques have their own mlvl.
* **qlvl**: quality level of the item. qlvl is used to determine what prefixes and suffixes an item may have.

#### Magic Finding

MF is your chance to find items. Your MF will increase when you carry an item with the mod "Better Chance of Getting Magic Item".

The higher your MF, the higher the rate of dropping **magic + set + unique** items. Here is the formula to calculate MF:

* Uniques = MF \* 250 / (MF+250)
* Sets = MF \* 500 / (MF+500)
* Rares = MF \* 600 / (MF+600)
* Magic = MF

This means that when you have a total MF of 100% from the items you wear, your chance of picking up unique items will increase to 100\*250/(100+250) \~ 71%. Sets will increase by 83.3% and rares by 85.7%.

In addition, the number of players in the room also affects MF. If offline, typing player8 will give you the highest rate, but the monsters will be stronger. Each time you defeat a monster, the game will determine what it drops for you. The more players there are, the higher the chance of mobs dropping items. Note that this only affects the quantity, not the quality of the items, except for runes.When you kill a monster, the game will determine if it drops an item or not. If it does, the game will decide what type of item it is, whether it suits the **mlvl**, factor in your mf to see if it's unique, set, rare, or magic, white.

Items that drop will have around 5% chance of being Ethereal, increasing damage by 50% for weapons or defense for armors, helms, etc. Items with "Indestructible" will not break, their durability will not decrease. Some items always have this, while others like Shadow Killer have both ethereal and indestructible, doubling damage without getting damaged.

#### The Pit <a href="#the-pit" id="the-pit"></a>

Pits are areas with arealvl = 85. Monsters + chests here have minimum level = 85.

- Act 1: The mausoleum (next to quest 2).
- Act 1: Pits (the dungeon in the Tamoe Highland).
- Act 2: Ancient Tunnel (found in Lost City).
- Act 4: River of Flame and Chaos Sanctuary.
- Act 5: From World Stone Keep onwards.

As you can see, maybe the first 3 areas are the easiest to run mf because the mobs in A1 and A2 are weaker than the pits.

- Andariel (Nightmare and Hell): best for running Stone of Jordan (Nightmare). In Hell, this monster drops the highest quality runes.
- Council (Hell): Over 3 unique monsters, easy to defeat, fast to run, drop quite good runes.
- Mephisto (Hell): This boss is the easiest to kill, not too strong, low health, also sorceress can use the moat trick to kite this monster, details will be discussed later.* Pindleskin (Hell): This boss is quite easy, stubborn, and easy to kill. It only takes 20-30 seconds for one run. You can do over 100 runs in one hour. Pindleskin is located at the Nik Temple, where you do q4. Note that in order to run this boss, DO NOT DO q4 because once you finish it or take the waypoint, the red portal will disappearâ€”>end of the run
* Baal (Nightmare and Hell): Of course, this boss has the best drop rate in the game, but encountering it takes quite a long time, almost 6 minutes per run.
* Countess: Countess drops very good runes, and if you have high Magic Find (MF), Countess will also drop some valuable items. Below is a small table about the rune drop chances when running Countess:
  * Lo â€“ 0.000312%
  * Ohm â€“ 0.000468%
  * Vex â€“ 0.000546%
  * Gul â€“ 0.000819%
  * Ist â€“ 0.074436%
  * Mal â€“ 0.111654%
  * Um â€“ 0.130038%
  * Pul â€“ 0.195056%
* Chaos Sanctuary is also a pit, but only Hammerdin can run it because this area is quite tough, with various elemental attacks, curses, especially Iron Maiden and Amplify Damage.

#### Overview of Runes <a href="#so-luoc-ve-rune" id="so-luoc-ve-rune"></a>

A rune is a special type of item in Diablo II. It is similar to gems and jewels but the difference is that it can create an item with unique properties by correctly selecting and using the right rune with an item. Another important note is that the rune drop rate is not affected by the character's Magic Find. It only depends on the monster's mlvl. Specifically as follows:

| **mlvl** | **Possible Rune Drops** |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| 66       | Vex                      |
| 69       | Lo                       |
| 74\[75]  | Ber                      |
| 78\[79]  | Cham                     |
| 83\[84]  | Zod                      |

The number in square brackets applies to melee monsters. This means that a mlvl 75 melee monster can drop the Ber rune. The more players in a game, the higher the chance of rune drops. When hunting for runes, always remember: the more high mlvl monsters you kill, the better. All high mlvl monsters are equally valuable, and if you kill them all, the rune drop chances will be higher. The next part covers various rune hunting strategies.#### The Countess 
Introducing a bit about Countess. Countess has mlvl 82 and TC 66. TC 66 allows Countess to drop up to Lo rune and other cute items like thunderstroke, ormus robe, mara,... and so on. Additionally, Countess also has the ability to drop special runes, allowing drop up to Ist rune. When Countess dies, the game will first check how many items Countess drops (up to 5, and this is called "no drop check").

If Countess drops all 5 items, the game will stop checking, meaning Countess's special rune check will be skipped. If Countess drops less than 5 items, the special rune check will be "noticed" but not more than 3 runes. If you still don't understand, I will explain further as follows: when Countess dies, the first no drop check will start. If the no drop check fails, it means Countess drops 1 item like other mobs. If the no drop check is successful, then the special rune check comes into play. Then continue with the second no drop check and this happens 5 times for Countess to drop 5 items for you. Maximum of 3 special rune checks. The "no drop" chance for a solo game is about 26%. When playing with multiple people, this chance decreases, so it is very likely that the special rune check will not be checked. Therefore: When planning to run Countess, solo is the best.

Next is about the types of runes Countess can drop. This is divided into 2 types: regular (the "no drop check" mentioned above) and special (this is Countess's unique rune dropping ability). I only mention this at Hell level because Nightmare and Normal are not worth our attention. At this level, Countess drops the highest Lo rune for regular and Ist for special. The table below shows all the possible runes that Countess can drop:

* Lo â€“ 0.000312%
* Ohm â€“ 0.000468%
* Vex â€“ 0.000546%
* Gul â€“ 0.000819%
* Ist â€“ 0.074436%
* Mal â€“ 0.111654%
* Um â€“ 0.130038%
* Pul â€“ 0.195056%
* Lem â€“ 0.259175%
* Fal â€“ 0.388763%
* Ko â€“ 0.514776%
* Lum â€“ 0.772164%
* Io â€“ 1.015448%
* Hel â€“ 1.523172%
* Dol â€“ 1.976007%
* Shael â€“ 2.964010%
* Sol â€“ 3.744013%* Amn â€“ 5.616020%
* Thul â€“ 6.126567%
* Ort â€“ 9.189850%
* Ral â€“ 8.752238%
* Tal â€“ 13.128357%
* Ith â€“ 10.502686%
* Eth â€“ 15.754029%
* Nef â€“ 15.003837%
* Tir â€“ 22.505755%
* Eld â€“ 27.006907%
* El â€“ 40.510360%

As mentioned above, the Lo rune falls into the category of regular drops, so when you play in a crowded 1 game, the drop rate will be higher. Specifically, the chance of dropping a Lo rune in a game of 8 players is 0.00056%. Because of this, if you want to find a Lo rune, playing in a crowded game will increase your chances of success. However, the more players there are, the lower the chance of dropping a rune from special rune checks. If you feel lucky, then play in an 8-player game to run Countess. But if you prefer the "safe and steady" approach, then solo play is the best. Personally, I still support solo play because the odds of upgrading from Ist to Lo in the cube are only 1/16.

P/S: The above information is for LoD Original, there may be some changes in D2VN, but I think it's not significant.

Best running characters:

* Hammerdin: Chaos Sanctuary: mobs there are immune to all 4 elements, plus there's iron maiden and lower resist.
* BlizSor: Mephisto, Ancient Tunnels, can also run Andariel but it takes a while and is dangerous.
* FireSor: Mephisto, Andariel (very fast), Andariel has -50 fire resistance, ideal for fire sorceress.
* LightSor: Pindleskin, Shenk, Eldritch, various super uniques, lots of minions, low health (if you have Infinity, still good for running Chaos Sanctuary).
* Winddruid: From Spider Forest to Lower Kurast, mobs here are numerous but low health, perfect for wind.
