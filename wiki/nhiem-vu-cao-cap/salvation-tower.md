### Overview and storyline of Salvation Tower <a href="#salva5" id="salva5"></a>

* As we know, humanity was saved by the letter of Tyrael in the trial from the High Heavens. Peace has been restored, but the conspiracy of Hell still persists. During the Dark Exile, the Three Prime Evils Baal, Mephisto, and Diablo descended into the Sanctuary. However, this plot was thwarted by the Archangel of Justice - Tyrael.
* The group of heroes defeated Mephisto in the Zakarum burial grounds, but Diablo had already arrived at the Pandemonium Fortress to use it as a foothold to attack the High Heavens. However, Diablo failed to do so as the heroes pursued him to the end and eventually destroyed him in Hell. The Soulstone containing the soul of Mephisto was also destroyed by the heroes in the Hellforge to prevent his return. As for Baal, after being freed, he sought out the peak of Mount Arreat, where Inarius placed the Worldstone and entrusted it to the Barbarian tribe to guard. Baal's army attacked Arreat, causing horror throughout the area. Before Baal could possess the Worldstone, the heroes defeated him. However, Baal seemed to have succeeded in tainting the cosmic artifact, and Tyrael had no choice but to destroy the Worldstone, causing a tremendous shock throughout the Sanctuary.* It seems like the world of Diablo 2 has ended here, but no, the entities from this hell are extremely powerful. Although the physical body is dead and the soul is sealed in stones containing the soul, they can still be resurrected by creating dark energy around the stone. From there, they possess the bodies of those who approach the places where they are kept to resurrect.
