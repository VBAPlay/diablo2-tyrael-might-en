# DESYNCH BUG

## Instructions:

* Due to a lack of PvP combat skills, some players have decided to reduce the use of keys on their keyboards and create their own playstyle - Jodering (or known as shaking). It's simply desynching around the map and spamming Invisible Hammers, hoping to catch some newcomers off guard. They even consider ways to make desynching more effective (colliding with holes, getting stuck in house walls, hitting faces into summons, etc.).

Therefore, they have created an illusion about using Desynch skills. Like you have to be experienced, so you can master this "technique" and make Desynch better.

* What you need to know is that by using Charge + Vigor, we can move quite fast from one point to another with a little sidestep. This way, we can dodge some missiles (Bone Spirit, Guided Arrow). So, in general, Charge + Vigor can sometimes be useful in HvB (Hammerdin vs BvC), HvD (Hammerdin vs Dudu), HvZ (Hammerdin vs Zon), and HvN (Hammerdin vs Necro).
* In practice, mastering this technique is not something you should do. However, you should be aware of it. In some dual-handed combats against casters, an unexpected move forward and a few Couple Hammers - 2 hammers cast at once (Random 1 2 hammers / invisible) can surprise the opponent.
