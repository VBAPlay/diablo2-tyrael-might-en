**\~ C-T Trick \~**

* C-T Trick originates from the defaults but always has something hidden to help us understand that it is completely effective, even much stronger than what we know in PvP.

**C - Character Screen** (Character Stats Screen)\
**T - Skill Tree** (Skill Tree)

* Of course, these Bind buttons should be changed or even left as is. Personally, I bind the buttons as follows: A - (Character screen) and G - (Skill Tree) but when playing Hdin, I have to bind more buttons. It may be inconvenient because Hdin has to bind quite a few buttons, but the important thing is whether you are comfortable or familiar with the buttons when performing combos or not.\

* The issue with this trick is that when you open a specific sheet (Stats and Skill Tree), we can increase the radius (but I think it looks more like a rectangle) of skills such as Teleport and Lightning Sentry.
* Other skills may work, but unlike Teleport and Light Sentry, they do not have as much impact in combat as these 2 skills. This is the starting point of Teleport Paladin and the distance you can cover by teleporting on the left or right side of the screen.\

* When pressing "A" (open Character Screen) and using Teleport on the side or corner of the screen, its length increases by half (from right to left. Height does not increase). Don't aim at the top edge of the screen, it won't have any effect.".* By using C - T, you can surpass your opponent even though they may have a greater distance with Teleport, but they do not use C - T. In this video, an Assassin (102fcr - 9 Frame Teleport) is using C - T to surpass a Necro (125fcr - 8 Frame Teleport) using regular Teleport.
* C - T is a very useful tip when playing as an Assassin and setting Traps. Traps will be placed at a distance 1.5 times further. Sometimes the Necro will not expect that traps have already been set along their path.
* !!! If you look closely, it is usually visible that if not using C-T but placing a Trap close to the screen, the trap will be visible. Now, watch the video closely to see how Traps are placed further away !!!
* Just give it a try!! At first, I was very confused too. There were many times when I opened the wrong Panel or forgot to close one side of the Panel. After a month, I made more progress. The confusion became less frequent. After 2-3 months, I became accustomed to using Control C-T to perform this trick more effectively than ever.
* However, this does not mean that you should try to perform Teleport or Trap using C-T frequently. By doing so, you will surely make a mistake at some point (possibly fatal). But it's okay, with much practice and drawn experience, you will know when to use C-T and when not to. It is mainly used to catch someone, quickly fly away, fly fast, and perform a surprise hit, set traps along the Necro's path (where they do not expect you to go first or where instances of IBS may occur).
* Using C-T to spam Teeth is also very useful (the path of Teeth will be shorter and have the potential to cause more damage).
