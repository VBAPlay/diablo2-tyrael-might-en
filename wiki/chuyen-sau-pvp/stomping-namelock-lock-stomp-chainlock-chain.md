## NameLock [Lock (Stomp)]

Let's start with the basics. The issue with Namelock is to quickly and accurately target the opponent's Name.

* This is very important. You will need it in most PvP scenarios. In fact, Namelock is your target, it's your reaction, accuracy, and speed. It means, it is your default skill foundation, it is experience accumulated over many months and even years.
* If you are not accurate with your mouse or your speed is slow. Go to steam and download Aim Lab. Of course it's free ^^

## Lock [Stomp]

* Approach the player. Lock the name with any attack skills (e.g., Fire Ball, Bone Spear, Lightning) and Teleport by right-click. Quickly move the mouse to the center of the screen. Capture the Name of the opponent with any attack skills (If right-handed, use skills on the right and vice versa) and aim the cursor to your character's feet (on the knee of our character).

* Then switch to Teleport. The result is that after Teleport, our cursor is back on the opponent's name. Switch to attack skills, right-click once again, and defeat them.

If you don't move the cursor to your knee or to the center of the screen, you may shoot in a different direction other than the enemy, and your enemy will kill you immediately.{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shjMoB0xOus" %}

* It's worth noting that the player who Stomps first has an advantage in PvP blood trades. In many PvP duels, the one who Stomps first = wins.
* It's also important to remember that Lock works within a specific radius, and once the opponent can avoid it, the Lock will be lost.
* At first, when you do everything, it may look awkward and slow. But don't worry. Everything comes with experience. Before you know it, you will sharpen your perception, muscles, and the initially complex Lock will become easy and simple.

## \~Chainlock\~

This is essentially the second technique upgraded by the Lock technique. Your opponent won't always stay still, and as soon as they sense the Lock incoming, they will simply fly away. It's no surprise; while performing the Lock, we moved the cursor down below the knee. Now, after the opponent is Locked, their name will be retained with an attack Skills (We refresh another Lock), meaning you can perform another Lock. In fact, Multiple Lock is a Chainlock. This technique also requires high skill and persistent practice. In 1 - 2 days, you can start Chainlocking.

## \~Chain\~

* This technique is quite simple. Immediately, when your opponent suspects you are Chainlocking, they will instantly Zip out of your radius at a tremendous speed (Drag the mouse to the corner of the screen and Teleport). You won't have enough time to perform the Chainlock, and the opponent will Zip away. Now, you can easily pursue them by using Chain. To do this, after holding the attack Skills and moving the cursor to the knee, switch to Teleport and still hold RMB (Right Click) to match the opponent's Teleport rhythm.

* It is crucial to accurately target the middle or knee of your character. Based on personal experience, it has a longer "Butt Cling."* The important thing is not to fly aimlessly and not to attack until the opponent starts to attack, otherwise, this technique will turn you into a clown and you will just be their plaything.
* If the opponent stops and starts attacking you, you can still move around or jump to another spot.
* Chains often break when the opponent performs Teleport next to holes or walls. It is always more effective on a clean path.

If your opponent uses Oak or Golem, executing Chain becomes even easier. The chance of Chain breaking at a "clean" distance is nearly 0.

## ~Chainlock + Chain~

* Simply combining these two techniques. After gaining some PvP experience with a specific Player, you will learn their habits. For example, how many Teleports they perform before doing it again, or counterattacking, you will need to guess when you need to "Stick" with Chain and when to perform Chainlock.

* Those who always Teleport like madmen (with lots of screen corner movements), will surely do it wisely, but you can still catch them. For example, in NvN, a Necro often catches a fleeing Necro with Spear. Obviously, this is because of the frame matching for Necros performing Teleport at the same time.
* While the pursued Necro uses Teleport with 9 Frames, the chasing Necro catches him with Bone Spear. So, the surprised pursued Necro falls into FHR and dies.
* On long straight paths, it is best to use Chain, and on "curved" paths, use Chainlock. For the first part of the leap, the enemy can keep Teleport in the upper right corner of the screen. This way, he can fly out of the Chainlock area before you manage him and execute it even when you do everything as fast as you can.
* A skilled combination of these two techniques allows us to stick close to the opponent and not let them slip away.
