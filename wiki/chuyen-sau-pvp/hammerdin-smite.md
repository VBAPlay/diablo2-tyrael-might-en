    ## ~Swirls [Smite]~

    * The swirling bird effects above your head (known as -Swirls-) famous from Assassin’s Mind Blast also appear with Smite and Shock Wave. The issue with these birds is that until they circle around your head - any sign of attack with any damage triggers Faster Hit Recovery animation. If not swirling, FHR will only occur when you receive damage that takes at least 1/16 of your health in one hit. The more percentage of health taken - the more chance, up to 100%.
    * So, in summary, while you are swirling, any damage will trigger FHR.
    * With skillful hands, we can use this trick when playing Druid, Hammerdin, Smiter.
    * The Skill Smite causes your enemies to swirl like MB. This allows you to perform a trick:\
      **Smite> Foth> Throw> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**.

* This trick is a bit difficult to learn, but it will be deadly once mastered. When executed correctly, we will land on our enemy as soon as FotH hits their head (or even a bit earlier. Our swirling enemies will get hit with FHR after FotH, so there is about a 60% chance to hit them with Hammer (which you will use right after Namelocks Teleport). The trick is a bit random and depends on ping (will be explained later). It can be flawed due to timing errors or strange server synchronization. When properly executed, I will estimate the Nec’s survival chance at 40%.
* Now about the execution of this trick. If you try to perform this trick when **FotH> Throw> Teleport**, you will see a delay between FotH and TP, about 1 second. During this time, your enemy can easily escape the radius of Namelock Teleport."{%embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl1xVdi4x_U"%}

To perform it without delay, a certain issue must be explained. Surely some of you are wondering why I mentioned before:

**Smite> Throw> FotH> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**

and should do the following combo:

**Smite> FotH> Throw> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**

The issue is if you try to perform this trick in Single Player (no ping there), you will not succeed, no matter how hard you try. The game itself has a 1-second delay embedded after transmitting FotH. So, this trick can only be performed on a server and for the following reason:
- You need to press Throw before FotH. By doing that, the Game's application will send an additional data packet to the server and "confuse" it to ignore the delay. Pressing Throw after FotH is useless.
- What we do:
- Find a target, Smite it, click on a random spot with Throw (LMB - Shift Left Mouse), and immediately (0.5 seconds) FotH (LMB - Right Mouse) (btw not necessary to aim directly at the Name or Namelocks them, it works even when clicking outside - meaning no need to target a target). Immediately after, we Target the target with Teleport (RMB - Right Mouse) and move the cursor down to the knees. You can even perform Chainlock (no need to aim and refresh the Lock by RMB):

**Smite> Throw> FotH> Throw> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**

The trick works better with high ping (120-130). Even level 1 players connect to a proxy server to increase their ping (if it is too low. With perfection, this trick hardly ever occurs).
As in the case with Nec, the trick will be more effective when used on a running Necro (Smite is better used with Fanaticism. The breakpoint difference is quite small. Catching Necro with Smite but without Fanaticism will be much harder).* If you try to use it after Chainlock, you may be deceived into an IBS Train (also known as the invisible bone Prison train) or accidentally hit Golem / Oak and take all the Missiles to the face.
* If you still don't know what IBS Train is, you can refer to [here](https://tm.diablo2-vn.com/huong-dan-pvp/necrobone-ibs-train/?preview\_id=10102\&preview\_nonce=8725f0b895\&post\_format=standard&\_thumbnail\_id=-1\&preview=true)

* ## \~Tip Hammerdin vs ES Sorc\~
* This trick is a must if you want to kill an ES Fire – Light – Cold Sorc. However, a cunning Sorc can spam you with Fire Balls and cause you to have FHR. If you make a mistake, you may be stunned and knocked out by Fire Balls.

It would be safer to run around a bit with Vigor + Charge immediately after hitting with Smite and then perform the technique:\
**Throw> FotH> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**

It's best to keep a certain distance as in the video before executing the Combo.
