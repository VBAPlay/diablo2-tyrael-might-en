# NecroBone \[IBS Train]

## Guide:

**\[IBS Train] \~ Invisible Bone Spirit Train \~**

* The train is a technique of the Necromancer, flying on a train called Bone Spirit. It is a very simple trick. We keep the Bone Spirit skill in any corner of the screen. After using Bone Spirit five times, we switch to TP and immediately return to Bone Spirit. The cursor does not move.
