## Area85

> Pits (also known as area85) is a special place where all monsters are at level 85. This is an area where monsters are relatively easy to defeat and drop a good amount of equipment such as _DIADEM, TROLL BELT, CORONA,â€¦.._also includes _SOUL_, _CHEST SOUL_, and even _High Rune._ And this area85 is only common in Hell, and of course, there is no Normol and Nightmare difficulty levels.
