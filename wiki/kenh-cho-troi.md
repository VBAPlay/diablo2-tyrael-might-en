Step 1: Log in to your d2vn account on the website or directly in the game client\
Step 2: Select the market section -> ladder or non-ladder server to access the correct server where you want to buy items. Here you can directly enter the item name in the search box to find the item you want to purchase

Step 4: Here, you will need to select the name of the character in your account who you want to receive the item. If your account has only one character, no need to adjust, but if you have two or more characters, you have to tick here to select the character -> purchase with fgold

**Note :**

* Items purchased upon receipt will be received one by one if you buy multiple items
* In case you selected the wrong character to receive the item, select the purchased items -> find the item you just bought and click EDIT.
* Then you click to select the character's name and choose the desired character to receive, as long as you have not received the item in the inventory, you can still edit
* For the situation where your inventory is full, the received item will go to the cube, the full cube will go to the stash. As for the case of a full stash, I haven't tried it :)) .
* For special items that can only be carried one on the body like High Runes or Annihilus, you must store that item in the stash to receive it.
