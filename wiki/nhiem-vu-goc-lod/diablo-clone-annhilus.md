SoJ is truly one of the best unique rings of Diablo II. There are many questions online about how to find SoJ.\
**Where to find Stone of Jordan Ring**\
You can find SOJ in many ways, any monster with a level above 39 (Mlvl>39) has a chance to drop SOJ. Even chests in nightmare and hell can drop SOJ. However, the chances range from: 1:1000 to 1:15000000. Here is the order of places where you can find SOJ from most to least:

1. Nightmare Andariel, Normal Diablo.
2. Normal Baal, Nightmare and Hell Act Bosses.3. Councils. All monsters in Act1, Act2 and Act3 in NM.  
4. All monsters are above level 38.  
5. All corpse boxes in nightmare and hell (except the beginning of nightmare act 1). Gambling.

As you can see, nightmare andariel is considered the best place to find SOJ. Because in nightmare, nightmare andariel has a level of 49, so there is a chance to drop SOJ, but no chance for higher unique rings, and andariel is easy to kill, dropping 6 items each time she dies. The chance of finding SOJ at andariel if she drops 1 unique ring is 1:31.  
**How much +%magic find (MF) should be used**  
The higher the MF, the more chances you have to find unique items (refer to the table above). Of course, I have also said not to sacrifice everything for MF when your character is too weak to kill monsters. The number of runs also greatly affects the result. Here is an overall table on running nightmare andariel that I have collected, take a look and determine for yourself how much MF is reasonable:  

+MF................ Chance to find SOJ for 1 run, %........... Chance to find SOJ for 1000 runs, %  
-------------------------------------------------  
0................ 0.0489.............. 38.66  
50.............. 0.0692.............. 49.97  
100............ 0.0838.............. 56.75  
150............ 0.0947.............. 61.22  
200............ 0.1032.............. 64.38  
250............ 0.1100.............. 66.72  
300............ 0.1155.............. 68.52

1000.......... 0.1466.............. 76.94

1. Carry SoJ with you, go to Akara Act I, and sell it. (In Hell mode)
2. You will see the earth shaking and a message appearing (If you sell SoJ and Diablo Clone doesn't appear, it means you failed, there's a 30% chance Diablo Clone will appear)
3. Next, run to the first location with a Super Unique Monster waiting for you. Ta-da, DC will greet you warmly \
   That is the owner of Chaos Sanctuary – Act IV. In addition to familiar skills like Red Lightning Hose, Charge, Cold Touch, etc., Diablo Clone can also use Armageddon and regenerate health very quickly. \
   **Reward:** After Diablo Clone lies down under your feet (or you lie down, I don't know) You will pick up an extremely valuable Small Charm in the game.
