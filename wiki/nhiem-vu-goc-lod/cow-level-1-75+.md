# Cow Level 1 (75+)

## CONDITIONS NEEDED TO OPEN THE GATEWAY TO COW MAP:

1. To open Cow in 3 modes Normal – Nightmare – Hell, you must complete 3 modes Normal – Nightmare – Hell with corresponding levels of at least 20 – 40 – 60 in each mode.
   * **Example:** To open Cow Normal, you need to reach level 20 and defeat the final boss ATC 5 Normal to complete the Normal mode, then move on to Nightmare. Afterwards, you create a Normal room and can open Cow Normal.
2. Complete Quest 3 – ATC 1. At the position of 5 stone columns (Five Elements Mountain) there will be a red gate leading to where Deckard Cain (Sun Wukong) is being held captive by Ny Lai called Tristram.
   * Your task at this point is to remove the curse and to rescue Cain.
   * Next, you will run to the bottom left corner of the Mini map where there will be a long decaying corpse of unknown origin (maybe Ny Lai chose the wrong location to hold captive someone living), when you click on the corpse, an item will drop which is Wirt’s Leg (random from 1 – 3 sockets can socket anything). Of course, this is an important material you need to bring along.
3. The second material is Tome of Town Portal purchased from NPC Akara – ATC 1
4. The third material is the Horadric Cube collected when you open the Chest at Hallls of the Dead level 3 – ATC 2
5. Place the materials Wirt’s Leg and Tome of Town Portal into the Cube. Then click the Transmute button and meet the first 2 conditions, you will open the gateway to the Cow map – The world of sacred cows in legend. This is a beginner-friendly farming map in the early stages if playing Necr Summonner
