# Uber Tristram - Hellfire Torch

The first step is to collect the three necessary keys to open the first portal among the red portals. You will need the Key of Hate, Terror, and Destruction, which can only be found from some Boss Monsters and only in Hell difficulty.

* The Key of Terror is dropped by The Countess (Quest 4 Act I).

* The Key of Hate is obtained from The Summoner (Quest 5 Act II).

#### Opening Special Red Portal Areas:

* Once you have the keys, stand in Harrogath, in Hell difficulty, place one of them (1 Key of Hate, Terror, and Destruction) into your Horadric Cube and Transmute. A red portal will open to one of three locations, Matron's Den, Forgotten Sands, and Furnace of Pain. The portal that opens first is random, but if you do all three in the same room, you won't receive the same one twice.
* For this reason, you should have 9 Keys (3 of each type) to start, 3 Keys of each type so you can perform all of them in the same room.

* You should also stand in different places to spread the three portals, so they do not overlap and make choosing the correct one difficult (Many newbies are not aware of this issue and the result, well, you can guess =]]).
* You will add a fourth portal after completing these three.

The Matron's Den:

* Lilith drops Diablo's Horn, one of the three items needed to enter Uber Tristram.\

### Uber Tristram:

* To create a Red Portals leading to Uber Tristram, place Diablo’s Horn, Baal’s Eye, and Mephisto Brain into the Horadric Cube, and transmute them while standing in Harrogath in a Hell-difficulty game. A red portal will open, the fourth portal in that area if you have completed all of them in the same game. It will take you to Uber Tristram, where the real fun begins.

### Pandemonium Event Tips:

All characters in the game must be in Act V.\
It is not necessary to kill Baal Hell before proceeding with the Pandemonium Event.\
Spread out the Red Portals in Harrogath for easier entry.
