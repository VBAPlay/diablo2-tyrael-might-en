# Druid

## Druid

Druids are a race of warrior-poet-kings wanderers. They belong to the Children of the Earth, they formed a house in Scosglen. The Druids stay away from the use of traditional magic, or Dubhdroiacht, as they call it. Living by the Caoi Dúlra, a philosophy that encourages harmony with the natural world, instead, they practice a form of magic based on their close relationship with nature. Through this intimate kinship with the world of Sanctuary, a Druid has the power to control fire, earth, and wind. Druids are deeply connected with nature.
