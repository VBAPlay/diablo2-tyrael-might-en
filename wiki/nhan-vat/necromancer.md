# Necromancer

The dominance of a Necromancer over life and death grants this terrifying potion-making master the ability to summon armies of skeletons and revenants, as well as unleash poisons, curses, and deadly bone skills upon their foes.

To use SKILL EXTRA, your character must use the original LOD skill at the level of that skill at 20-30-40. SKILL EXTRAS will automatically appear according to the skill level.

* Skill level 20 – 1 skill extra
* Skill level 30 – 2 skill extras
