# Amazon

Amazon is a powerful female warrior of the Askari people, who belong to nomadic groups living around the plains near the Southern Sea. The nomadic lifestyle of these groups often leads to conflicts with other tribes, so Amazon is accustomed to fighting to protect herself. This way of life has made her fiercely independent and able to overcome harsh challenges and travel. While her archery skills are on par with those of Rogues, Amazon is also highly proficient in using Spears and Javelins, as well as dual-wielding in combat. The weapons of Amazon are items that only she can equip. These include special Bows, Javelins, and Spears. Amazon is highly sought after as a mercenary, in a type of service to which she will remain loyal as long as her own goals are also served.
