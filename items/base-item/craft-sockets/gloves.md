# Gloves

## Introduce

Gloves can use Jeweller Gloves to craft more sockets. With Gloves that have already used Jeweller Gloves to the maximum of +1 sockets, those Gloves can still use Jeweller to craft more sockets with a maximum of +2 / +3 / +4 (only rolling sockets, other options remain unchanged).
