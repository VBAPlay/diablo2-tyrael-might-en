# Armor

## Introduce

In Diablo 2 Tyrael Might, there is a significant adjustment in Item Bases, also known as Runeword bases. Item Bases are still fundamentally rooted in the original game mechanics, but now offer more random options when you craft the Implict.

## How to Implict

Now, in addition to having to farm for runeword bases, you can also roll the base with better stats (see table below).

This feature allows for the Implict item to have a chance to add from 1 to 3 stats.
