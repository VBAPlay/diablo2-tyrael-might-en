# Shield

## Introduce

In Diablo 2 Tyrael Might, there is a significant change in Item Bases, also known as Runeword bases. Item Bases still follow the original game mechanics, but now offer more random options when the Implict is activated.

## How to Implict

Now, in addition to the runeword effects that you used to have to farm for, you can also roll the base with better stats (see table below).

This new feature means that Implict items will have a chance to receive additional bonuses ranging from 1 to 3 options.

## Item can use

Only available for ELITE SHIELD.
