## Introduction

In Diablo 2 Tyrael Might, there is a major adjustment in Item Bases, also known as Runeword sockets. Item Bases still follow the original game mechanics, but now offer more random options when the Implict is forged.

## How to Forge the Implict

Previously, runewords had to be farmed to earn, but now the base can also be rolled with better stats (see table below).

This new feature allows the Implict item to gain additional properties, ranging from 1 to 3 options.

## Items Eligible for Use

Only available for ELITE SHIELDS.
