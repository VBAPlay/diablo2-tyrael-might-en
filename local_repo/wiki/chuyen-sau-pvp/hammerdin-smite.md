## Swirls [Smite]

* The effect of the birds on your head (also known as -Swirls-) famous from Assassin's Mind Blast also appear from Smite and Shock Wave. The issue with these birds is that until they fly around your head - any sign of attack along with any damage will trigger the Faster Hit Recovery animation. If not swirling, FHR will only occur when you receive damage that is at least 1/16 of your HP in one hit. The more percentage of HP taken away - the more chances, up to 100%.
* So, in conclusion, while you are swirling, any damage will trigger FHR.
* With skillful hands, we can use this trick when playing Druid, Hammerdin, Smiter.
* Smite skill makes your enemies swirl like MB. This allows you to perform a trick:\
  **Smite > Foth > Throw > Teleport > Hammer + Concentration**.

* This trick is a bit challenging to learn, but it will be deadly once mastered. If done correctly, we will land on our enemies right when FotH hits their heads (or even a bit earlier. Our swirling enemy will be FHR after FotH, so there's about a 60% chance to hit them with Hammer (you will use it right after Namelocks Teleport). The trick is a bit random and depends on ping (will be explained later). It may fail due to wrong timing or weird server synchronization. When performed properly, I estimate the Nec's suiness chance is 40%.
* Now about the execution of this trick. If you try to perform this trick when **FotH > Throw > Teleport**, you will notice a delay between FotH and TP, about 1 second. During this time, your enemies can easily suie out of the range of Namelock Teleport.{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yl1xVdi4x_U" %}

To execute it without delay, a certain issue must be explained. Surely some of you are wondering why I mentioned earlier:

**Smite> Throw> FotH> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**

* and should perform the combo below

**Smite> FotH> Throw> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**

* The issue is if you try to perform this trick in Single Player (without ping there), you will not succeed, no matter how hard you try. The game itself has a 1-second delay embedded after casting FotH. Therefore, this trick can only be performed on a server and for the following reason:
* You need to press Throw before FotH. By doing so, the Game application will send an additional data packet to the server and "confuse" it to skip the delay. Pressing Throw after FotH is useless.
* What we do:
* Find a target, Smite it, click on a random spot with Throw (LMB - Shift Left Mouse), and immediately (0.5 seconds) use FotH (LMB - Right Mouse) (btw not necessary to aim directly at the Name or Namelocks, it works even when you click outside - meaning no need to Target the target). Immediately after that, we Lock the target with Teleport (RMB - Right Mouse) and move the cursor down to the knees. You can even perform Chainlock (without aiming and refreshing the Lock with RMB):

**Smite> Throw> FotH> Throw> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**

* The trick works better with high ping (120-130). Level 1 players even connect to a proxy server to increase their ping (if it's too low. With perfection, this trick hardly ever happens).
* As in the case with Nec, the trick will be more effective when used on a running Necro (Smite is better to use with Fanaticism. The breakpoint difference is quite small. Hitting the Necro with Smite but no Fanaticism will be much harder).* If you try to use it after Chainlock, you may be tricked into IBS train (also known as bone Prison invisible train) or accidentally hit Golem / Oak and take all the Missiles in the face.
* If you still don't know what IBS Train is, you can refer to it [here](https://tm.diablo2-vn.com/huong-dan-pvp/necrobone-ibs-train/?preview\_id=10102\&preview\_nonce=8725f0b895\&post\_format=standard&\_thumbnail\_id=-1\&preview=true)

* ## \~Hammerdin vs ES Sorc Tips\~
* This trick is a must-have if you want to kill an ES Fire – Light – Cold Sorc. However, a clever Sorc can spam you with Fire Balls and make you FHR. If you make a mistake, you may get stunned and be hit by Fire Balls until fainting.

It's safer to run around a bit with Vigor + Charge right after you hit with Smite and only then perform the technique:\
**Throw> FotH> Teleport> Hammer + Concentration**

It's best to keep a certain distance as in the clip before executing the Combo.
