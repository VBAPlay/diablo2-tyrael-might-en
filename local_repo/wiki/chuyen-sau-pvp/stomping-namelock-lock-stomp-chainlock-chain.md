## ~NameLock [Lock Name]~

Let's start with the basics. The issue with NameLock is to aim at the opponent's Name quickly and accurately.

* This is very important. You will need it in most PvP situations. In fact, Namelock is your target, it's your reaction, accuracy, and speed. It means that it is your skill foundation, it's experience accumulated over many months and even years.
* If you are not accurate or fast with your mouse movements. Go to steam and download Aim Lab. Of course it's free ^^

## ~Lock [Stomp]~

* Approach the player. Lock the name with any attack skills (e.g. Fire Ball, Bone Spear, Lightning) and Teleport by right-clicking. Quickly move the mouse back to the center of the screen. Grab the opponent's Name with any attack skills (Right-handers use skills on the right and vice versa) and position the cursor default to your feet (on our character's knees).

* Then switch to Teleport. The result is that after Teleport, our cursor is back on the opponent's name. Switch to attack skills, right-click once again and kill them.

If you do not move the cursor to your knees or back to the center of the screen, you may shoot in a different direction other than the enemy, and your enemy will kill you immediately.{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shjMoB0xOus" %}* It is worth noting that whoever initiates the Stomp first in PvP blood trading has the advantage. In many PvP matches involving dual wielders, the one who initiates the Stomp first tends to win.
* It is also worth mentioning that Lock operates within a specific radius, and once the opponent escapes it, the Lock will be lost.
* In the beginning, when you are trying out everything, it may seem clumsy and slow. But don't worry. Everything will improve with experience. Before long, you will train your perspective, muscles, and the initially complex Lock will become easy and simple.

## ~Chainlock~

This is essentially the second technique built upon the Lock technique. Your opponent won't always stay still, and as soon as they sense the Lock is imminent, they will attempt to evade it. Not to worry, while executing the Lock, we lower the cursor to the knee. Now, after successfully Locking the opponent, their name will be retained with an attack Skills (preparing for another Lock), allowing you to Lock again. Essentially, Multiple Locks form a Chainlock. Mastering this technique requires high skill level and persistent practice; practicing for 1-2 days can lead to executing the Chainlock.

## ~Chain~

* This technique is relatively straightforward. If your opponent suspects you are performing a Chainlock, they will quickly Blink out of your reach at a rapid pace (moving the mouse to a corner of the screen and using Teleport). You won't have enough time to execute Chainlock, and the opponent will Blink away. Subsequently, you can easily pursue them using Chain. To do this, after initiating the attack Skills and moving the cursor to the knee, switch to Teleport and continue holding RMB (Right Click) in synchronization with the opponent's Teleport.

* The key is not to jump and not attack until the opponent starts attacking, otherwise, this technique will turn you into a clown and you will just be their plaything.
* If the opponent stops and starts attacking you, you can still maneuver around or jump to another spot.
* Chains are often broken when the opponent performs Teleport next to holes or walls. On a clear path, it is always more effective.

If your opponent uses Oak or Golem, performing Chain becomes even easier. The chance for Chain to break at a "clean" distance is close to 0.

## ~Chainlock + Chain~

* Simply combining these two techniques. After gaining some PvP experience with a specific Player, you will understand their habits. For example, how many Teleports they perform before striking again, or counterattacking, you'll need to guess when you need to "Stick with Chain" and when you need to perform Chainlock.

* Those who always Teleport like madmen (many movements at the corner of the screen) will surely act wisely, but they can still be caught. For example, in NvN, Necros often catch fleeing Necros with Spears. Obviously, this is because of the frames lining up for Necros to perform Teleport at the same time.
* While the fleeing Necro uses Teleport in 9 Frames, the pursuing Necro catches him with Bone Spear. Thus, the fleeing Necro is suddenly affected by FHR and dies.
* On long straight paths, it's best to use Chain, and on turns, use Chainlock. For the first part of the jump, the enemy may keep Teleport in the upper right corner of the screen. This way, they can escape the Chainlock area before you manage them and perform it even if you do everything as quickly as possible.
* Masterfully combining these two techniques allows us to stick close to the opponent and not let them slip away.
