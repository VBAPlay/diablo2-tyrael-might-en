**\~ C-T Trick \~**

* C-T Trick originates from the defaults available but always has something hidden to help us understand that it is entirely functional, even much stronger than what we know in PvP.

**C – Character Screen** (Character Stats Screen)\
**T – Skill Tree** (Skill Tree)

*   Of course, these Bind buttons should be changed or even left as they are. Personally, I also Bind the buttons as follows: A – (Character screen) and G – (Skill Tree) but when playing Hdin, I have to Bind more buttons. It may be a bit inconvenient because Hdin needs to Bind quite a few buttons, but what matters is whether you are comfortable or familiar with the buttons when performing Combos or not.\

* The issue with this trick is that when you open a specific panel (Stats and Skill Tree panel), we can increase the radius (but it looks more rectangular to me) of skills like Teleport and Lightning Sentry.
*   Other skills may work, but unlike Teleport and Light Sentry, they do not have as much impact in combat as these two Skills. This is the beginning of the Teleport Paladin and the distance you can step by Teleporting to the left or right of the screen.\

* When pressing "A" (open Character Screen) and using Teleport at the side or corner of the screen, its length increases by half (length from right to left. Height does not increase). Don't aim at the top edge of the screen as it has no effect.* By using C - T, you can overcome your opponent even though they are farther away with Teleport, but your foe does not use C - T. In this video, an Assassin (102fcr - 9 Frame Teleport) is using C - T and surpasses a Necro (125fcr - 8 Frame Teleport) using regular Teleport.
* C - T is a very useful trick when playing as an Assassin and setting Traps. Traps will be set further away by 1.5 times. Sometimes the Necro will not expect that there are traps set along their path.
* !!! If you pay close attention, normally if you do not use C-T and set traps close to the screen, you will see the trap, but now how about you pay attention to the video to see how the trap is set further away!!!
* Just give it a try!! At first, I was really confused. There were times when I opened the wrong panel or forgot to close one side of the panel. After a month, I made more progress. Mistakes became less frequent. After 2-3 months, I got used to controlling C-T to perform this trick more effectively.
* However, this does not mean you should try to perform Teleport or Trap using C-T frequently. Somehow, you will definitely make a mistake at some point (which could be fatal). But it's okay, with consistent practice and drawn experience, you will know when to use C-T and when not to. It is mainly used to catch someone, quickly fly away, fly fast, and perform a sudden strike, setting traps along the Necro's path (where they do not expect them to go first or ahead of IBS could occur).
* Using C-T to spam Teeth is also very useful (the path of Teeth will be more concise and have the potential to cause more damage).
