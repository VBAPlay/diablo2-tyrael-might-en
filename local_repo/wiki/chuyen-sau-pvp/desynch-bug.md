# DESYNC BUG

## Guide:

* Due to the lack of PvP combat skills, some players have decided to reduce their keyboard usage and create their own playstyle - Jodering (also known as shaking). It simply involves desynching around the map and spamming Invisible Hammers, hoping to catch new players off guard. They even consider ways to improve desynching (colliding with holes, getting stuck in house walls, hitting faces into summons, etc.).

Therefore, they have formed an illusion of skill in using Desynch. Like you have to be experienced, so you can master this "technique" and make Desynch better.

* What you need to know is that by using Charge + Vigor, we can move fairly quickly from one point to another with a little bit of minor movement. This way, we can dodge some missiles (Bone Spirit, Guided Arrow). So, in general, Charge + Vigor can sometimes be useful in HvB (Hammerdin vs BvC), HvD (Hammerdin vs Dudu), HvZ (Hammerdin vs Zon), and HvN (Hammerdin vs Necro).
* In practice, mastering this technique is not something you should do, however, you should be aware of it. In some dual fights against casters, a surprise cart goes ahead and a couple of Hammers - 2 hammers cast at once (Random 1 2 hammers / invisible) can surprise the opponent.
