SoJ is truly one of the best unique rings of Diablo II. There are many questions online about how to find SoJ.\
**Where to find Stone of Jordan Ring**\
You can find SOJ in many ways, any monster above level 39 (Mlvl>39) has the potential to drop SOJ. Even chests in Nightmare and Hell difficulties have a chance to drop SoJ. However, the drop rate ranges from 1:1000 to 1:15000000. Here is the order of places that can give you SOJ from most to least:

1. Nightmare Andariel, Normal Diablo.
2. Normal Baal, Nightmare and Hell Act Bosses.
3. Councils. All monsters in Act1, Act2, and Act3 are in Nightmare difficulty.
4. All monsters are higher than level 38.5. All corpse boxes in Nightmare and Hell (except the beginning of Act 1 in Nightmare). Gambling.

As you can see, Nightmare Andariel is considered the best place to find Stone of Jordan (SOJ). Because in Nightmare, Nightmare Andariel is at level 49, so there is a chance to drop SOJ, but there is no chance for higher unique rings, and Andariel is very easy to kill, giving out 6 items each time she dies. The chance of finding SOJ in Andariel if she drops 1 unique ring is 1:31.

**How much +%magic find (MF) should be used** The more Magic Find (MF) you have, the better the chance of finding unique items (refer to the chart above). Of course, I have also mentioned not to sacrifice everything for MF when your character is too weak to kill monsters. At the same time, the number of runs also greatly affects the results. Here is an overview table of running Nightmare Andariel that I have collected, please refer to it and decide how much MF is appropriate for yourself:

**Chance to find SOJ per run, % Chance to find SOJ for 1000 runs, %**

### II. Guide to creating Diablo clone (Uber Diablo) - Task of obtaining Anihilus Small Charm

1. Carry the SoJ with you, go to Akara in Act I, and sell it. (In Hell mode)
2. You will see the earth shaking and a notification appearing (If you sell the SoJ and Diablo Clone does not appear, it means you failed. There is a 30% chance of Diablo Clone appearing)
3. Then run to the first location where a Super Unique Monster is waiting for you. Tèng teng, Diablo Clone will welcome you courteously.\
   This is none other than the owner of Chaos Sanctuary - Act IV. In addition to familiar skills like Red Lightning Hose, Charge, Cold Touch, etc., Diablo Clone can also use Armageddon and regenerate health rapidly.\
   **Reward:** After Diablo Clone lies lifeless beneath your feet (or you lie down, I don't know), you will pick up an extremely valuable Small Charm in the game.
