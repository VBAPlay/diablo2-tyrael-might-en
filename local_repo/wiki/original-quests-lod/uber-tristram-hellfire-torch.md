# Uber Tristram - Hellfire Torch

The first step is to collect the three necessary keys to open the first portal among the red portals. You will need the Key of Hate, Terror, and Destruction, which can only be found from certain Boss Monsters and only on Hell difficulty.

* Key of Terror from The Countess (Quest 4 Act I).

* Key of Hate from The Summoner (Quest 5 Act II).

#### Opening Special Red Portal Areas:

* Once you have the keys, stand in Harrogath, on Hell difficulty, place one of them (1 Key of Hate, Terror, and Destruction) into your Horadric Cube and Transmute. A red portal will open to one of three areas, Matron’s Den, Forgotten Sands, and Furnace of Pain. The order in which the portals open is random, but if you do all three in the same room, you will not receive the same one twice.
* For this reason, you should have 9 Keys (3 of each type) to start, 3 of each type to do all of them in the same room.

* You should also stand in different locations to spread out the three portals, so they do not overlap and make choosing the correct one "difficult" (Many newbies do not understand this issue, and the result, well, everyone knows). 
* You will add a fourth portal after completing these three.

The Matron’s Den:* Lilith drops Diablo’s Horn, one of the three items required to open the portal to Uber Tristram.

* Uber Duriel drops Baal’s Eye, one of the three items required to open the portal to Uber Tristram.

**The Furnace of Pain:**

* Uber Izual drops Mephisto’s Brain, one of the three necessary items to open the portal to Uber Tristram.

### Uber Tristram:

* To create a red portal to Uber Tristram, place Diablo’s Horn, Baal’s Eye, and Mephisto Brain in the Horadric Cube, and transmute them while standing in Harrogath in a room of Hell difficulty. A red portal will open, the fourth portal in that area if you have completed all of them in the same room. It will take you to Uber Tristram, where the real fun begins.

### Pandemonium Event Tips:

All characters in the game must be in Act V.\
It is not necessary to kill Baal Hell before proceeding with the Pandemonium Event.\
Spread the red portals in Harrogath for easier access.
