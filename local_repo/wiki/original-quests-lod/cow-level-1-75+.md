# Cow Level 1 (75+)

## CONDITIONS REQUIRED TO OPEN THE PORTAL TO COW MAP:

1. To open Cow in 3 modes Normal â€“ Nightmare â€“ Hell, you must complete 3 modes Normal â€“ Nightmare â€“ Hell with corresponding levels of at least 20 â€“ 40 â€“ 60 in each mode.
   * **For example:** To open Cow Normal, you need to reach level 20 and defeat the final boss ATC 5 Normal to complete the Normal mode, move on to Nightmare. Then you create a Normal room and can open Cow Normal.
2. Complete Quest 3 â€“ ATC 1. At the position of 5 stone columns (NgÅ© HÃ nh SÆ¡n) there will be a red portal leading to the place where Deckard Cain (TÃ´n Ngá»™ KhÃ´ng) is held captive called Tristram.
   * Your task now is to remove the curse and rescue Cain.
   * Next, you will run to the bottom left corner of the Mini map where a long-decayed corpse of unknown origin lies (probably NhÆ° Lai chose the wrong location to hold someone), when you click on the corpse, you will drop an item called Wirtâ€™s Leg (random from 1 â€“ 3 sockets anything can be inserted). Of course, this is an important ingredient you need to bring along.
3. The second ingredient is Tome of Town Portal bought from NPC Akara â€“ ATC 1.
4. The third ingredient is the Horadric Cube collected when you open the Chest at Halls of the Dead level 3 â€“ ATC 2.
5. Put the ingredients Wirtâ€™s Leg and Tome of Town Portal into the Cube. Then click the Transmute button and meet the first 2 conditions, you will open a portal leading to the Cow map â€“ the Land of Cows in mythology. This is an easy farm map for Newbies in the early stages if playing Necr Summoner.
