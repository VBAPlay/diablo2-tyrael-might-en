# Area85

> Pits (also known as area85) is a special area where all monsters are at level 85. This is a region where monsters are relatively easy to defeat and drop a good amount of equipment such as _DIADEM, TROLL BELT, CORONA,â€¦.._ There are also _SOUL_, _CHEST SOUL,_ and even _High Rune._ This area85 is only common in Hell difficulty, and of course not in Normal and Nightmare difficulties.

> Here are some locations of Area85 in Hell:
