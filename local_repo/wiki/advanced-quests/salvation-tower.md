### Summary and Storyline of Salvation Tower <a href="#salva5" id="salva5"></a>

* As we know, humanity was saved by Tyrael's voucher in the trial from the High Heavens. Peace has been restored, but the schemes of Hell keep going. During the Dark Exile event, the Three Prime Evils Baal, Mephisto, and Diablo invaded the Sanctuary. However, this scheme was thwarted by the Archangel of Justice - Tyrael.
* The group of heroes defeated Mephisto in the Zakarum catacombs, but Diablo had reached the Pandemonium Fortress to use it as a base to attack the High Heavens. However, Diablo failed to accomplish this as the heroes eventually pursued him there and ultimately destroyed him in Hell. The Soulstone containing Mephisto's soul was also destroyed by the heroes in the Hellforge to prevent his return. As for Baal, once released, he sought out the summit of Mount Arreat, where Inarius placed the Worldstone and entrusted it to the Barbarian tribe to guard. Baal's army attacked Arreat, causing horror throughout the land. Before Baal could claim the Worldstone, the heroes defeated him. However, Baal seemed to have succeeded in corrupting the cosmic artifact, and Tyrael had no choice but to destroy the Worldstone, causing a devastating upheaval across the Sanctuary.* It seems like the world of Diablo 2 has ended here. However, the entities from this hell are incredibly powerful. Even though their physical bodies are dead and their souls are sealed into soul stones, they can still be revived by generating dark energy around the stones. They then possess the bodies of those who come near the places where they are kept to revive.
