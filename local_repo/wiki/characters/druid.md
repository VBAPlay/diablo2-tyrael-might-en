# Druid

## Druid

Druids are a group of warrior-poet-nature priests. Belonging to the Manaraach, they settled in Scosglen. Druids avoid using traditional magic, known as Dubhdroiacht. Following the philosophy of Caoi DÃºlra, which promotes harmony with the natural world, they practice a magic system rooted in their deep connection to nature. Through this close bond with the Sanctuary realm, Druids wield power over fire, earth, and wind. They are intricately linked to nature.
