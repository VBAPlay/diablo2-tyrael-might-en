# Druid

## Druid

Druids are a tribe consisting of warrior-poet-nature priests. Belonging to the Manaraach, they established their homes in Scosglen. Druids stay away from using traditional magic, or Dubhdroiacht, as they call it. Living by the philosophy of Caoi DÃºlra, which encourages unity with the natural world, instead, they practice a form of magic based on their close connection to nature. Through this intimate relationship with the Sanctuary world, a Druid has the power to control fire, earth, and wind. Druids are closely tied to nature.
