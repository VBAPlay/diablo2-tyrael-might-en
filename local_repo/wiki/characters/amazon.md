# Amazon

Amazon is a powerful female warrior of the Askari people, who belong to the wandering nomadic groups near the Southern Sea flatlands. The wandering nature of these groups often leads to conflicts with other tribes, so Amazon is accustomed to fighting to protect herself. This lifestyle has made her fiercely independent and able to overcome harsh challenges and travel. While her archery skills are on par with those of Rogues, Amazon is also highly proficient in using Spears and Javelins, as well as dual-wielding in combat. Amazon's weapons are items that only she can equip. These include specialized Bows, Javelins, and Spears. Amazon is highly sought after as a mercenary, in a service where she remains loyal as long as her own purposes are also served.
