## ðŸŒŽ Changing the game language

For most of the 80s and 90s first-generation gamers, the image of a rounded screen computer is quite familiar with classic games like Empire, CS 1.1.. or the iconic role-playing game Diablo 2. Up to now, Diablo 2 has been over 20 years old, but replaying it still brings back special emotions with a gameplay that is anything but boring for all gamers. If you want to relive a bit of your childhood, just download Diablo 2!
