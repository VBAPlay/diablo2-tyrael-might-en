## ðŸŒŽ Changing the game language

For most first-generation gamers of the 80s and 90s, the image of a CRT monitor is quite familiar, especially with classic games like Empire, CS 1.1, or the iconic role-playing game Diablo 2. Even though Diablo 2 is now over 20 years old, replaying it still evokes special emotions with gameplay that is far from boring for all gamers. If you want to reminisce about your childhood, simply download Diablo 2!
