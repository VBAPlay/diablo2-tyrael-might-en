Step 4: Here, you will need to select the name of the character in your account that you want to receive the item in the inventory. If your account has only one character, there is no need to adjust, but if you have more than 2 characters, you must check here to select the character -> purchase with fgold

**Note:**

* Items purchased when received will be received one by one if you buy in bulk
* In case you select the wrong character to receive the item, you can go to the purchased item section -> find the item you just bought and click EDIT.
* Then you click on the character's name and select the correct character to receive, as long as you have not received the item in the inventory, you can still make changes
* For full inventory, received items will go to the cube, a full cube will go to the stash. As for a full stash, I haven't tried yet :))".* For special items that can only be carried one on the character like HR or anni, you have to store that item in the stash in order to receive it.
